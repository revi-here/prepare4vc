***Conclusion***  
Around 55-60% of the members don’t visit back after their first month.
Aug2021 has significantly lower number (28%) which is noteworthy.
We also see that there is continuous access till 12 months for the same cohort members.
80% members of Jun2021 cohort didn’t return yet back for the past 6months.
None of the members who joined in Sep2021 returned back in October. 
Few members of Oct2020 cohort are seen after 20+months that comprises of members in host,moderator role

## Effectiveness of referral program  
### Active months  
![Active months](images/active.png 'Active months')   
Members in general are active for 2.5 to 3 months on an average.
Average inactive period is more (13 months) compared to active one.
Referred members show more inactive months comparitively

### Program Memberships

### Group Memberships
![Group Memberships](images/groups.png 'Group Memberships')  
We don’t see any significant difference with members who were referred irrespective of whatever area you look into - program, groups, join date, active months.  

## 2.Analyze where the members are coming from , visualization using a map, heatmap, etc. of where the membership is.  

### Members across the world

# Final Conclusion.   
From all the above points we see that we need to get some changes with IOS as IOS retention is lesser compared  
to Android and also conversion rate from free to paid user is way less..Users are not in free trial for required time period..  
So we need to either change the plan for free trial or add some interesting features to attract user to stay for the full time  
and proceed with paid subscription..'app.norbu.premium' can be given with some extra features in the range (15-20$)for Android  
users as more users prefer this price range...These changes will improve the retention rate and conversion rate ..
